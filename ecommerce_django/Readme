This is a code copy for the video tutorial on youtube 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wbfk16jEOk&t=7532s'.

Create a new file 'local.py' and insert all the content inside local_template.py with proper values. I keep the secret keys in my local.py which is in .gitignore :)

The code is done only upto 2:35:00 hours. I slept after that.
Do me a favor, fork it and push the remaining :)
